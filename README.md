# Project Name: Micronaut Bot

# INTRODUCTION

I have delayed building a BOT for fun from a while and finally got around getting this one done in a few hours of overnight coding. The commands are few, extendable to full functionality. I hope to add more contributors and further set of features once its live and available to access from an external server. ( I doubt I can leave my laptop running 24/7 lol :) )
