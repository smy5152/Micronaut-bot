# Project Name: Micronaut Bot

![screenshot](logo.jpg)

# Introduction

I have delayed building a BOT for fun from a while and finally got around getting this one done in a few hours of overnight coding. The commands are few, extendable to full functionality. I hope to add more contributors and further set of features once its live and available to access from an external server. ( I doubt I can leave my laptop running 24/7 lol :) )

## DESCRIPTION & HOW TO START THE BOT

### The Telegram-bot live link

- Click the link and it will launch The bot in your Desktop Telegram [MicronautBot](t.me/smy5152_bot)
- Search for `MicronautBot` & select the Bot with a Picture of the Sun Shining Bright ![screenshot](./images/search-bot-name.PNG)
